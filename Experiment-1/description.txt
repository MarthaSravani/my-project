In this experiment, we created a Student Registration Form using HTML and CSS.
The form has three fields: Name, Email, and Age. We used HTML5 validation to make sure the user fills in all the details correctly before submitting.
We also added some CSS styling to make the form look neat and easy to use.
This experiment helped us learn how to build basic forms, check user inputs, and improve the design with simple CSS.
